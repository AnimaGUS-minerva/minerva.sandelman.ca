This is another update to [Minerva in LXD form](/containers/2018/10/20/minerva-in-lxd-form).

The 3rd highway image is at:

    wget https://minerva.sandelman.ca/qcow/0e745ddb6a22fa7e9a783215a8d9dcb81386972a6e7e54ee97b721cda79b070b.tar.gz
    lxc image import \
    0e745ddb6a22fa7e9a783215a8d9dcb81386972a6e7e54ee97b721cda79b070b.tar.gz \
        --alias highway

This version adds a "rake highway:signcsr CSR=file.csr CERT=output.pem",
which will process a Certificate Signing Request, and produce an IDevID
based upon the provided public key, and the requested serialNumber.

A pre-existing instance of highway can be upgraded by running:

    lxc highway -- su - highway
    highway@highway0:~$ curl https://minerva.sandelman.ca/qcow/highway-20181115025559.tgz | tar -C / --unlink -x -z -v -f -
    ..

Verify that the current link was updated:

    highway@highway0:~$ ls -l current
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 highway highway 37 Nov 14 21:33 current -> /home/highway/releases/20181115025559

Then run any migrations that there might be:

    highway@highway0:~$ cd current
    highway@highway0:~/current$ rake db:migrate
    == 20181113230344 AddCertificateToDevice: migrating ===========================
    -- add_column(:devices, :idevid_cert, :text)
    -> 0.0050s
    == 20181113230344 AddCertificateToDevice: migrated (0.0060s) ==================
