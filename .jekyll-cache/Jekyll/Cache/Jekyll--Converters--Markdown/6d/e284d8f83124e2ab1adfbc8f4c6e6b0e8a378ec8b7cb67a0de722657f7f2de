I"h<p>You might wonder what the ducks are doing in the manufacturer, and
why a duck and ducklings are wandering up to the customs agent in the
Registrar Image.</p>

<p>It was suggested in the early days of ANIMA by Michael Richardson that the
imprinting process was rather like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)">Imprinting process</a>
process first described by biologist Konrad Lorenz.  In the story told in
many high school biology classes, ducklings would imprint on whatever looked
like a mother at a critical period in their development.</p>

<p>It turns out that more famous people (Stajano and Anderson) had previous
suggested exactly that in their 1999 paper, <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/1999-StajanoAnd-duckling.pdf">Resurrecting Duckling: security for ad-hoc wireless networks</a>.</p>

<p>Thus ducklings.</p>
