I"ê<p>You need to setup the config/database.yml with a connection to a valid
database.  This is the case for both MASA (highway) and Registrar (fountain).
You can use a local sqlite3 database with something like:</p>

<p>development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: /app/database/development.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000</p>

<p>This example is in docker/config/database.yml in fountain.</p>

<p>If you want to use postgresql running locally (recommended), then you can use
the â€œcan-o-pgâ€ which is integrated.  Make sure you have postgresql 8, 9 or 10,
installed (but you donâ€™t have to have it running).
Make sure that you have checked up all submodules:
     git submodule init
     git submodule update</p>

<p>and then run â€œmakeâ€ from the main directory, and if find postgresql, then it
will initialize a database running in run/*.  No root required.
     â€œmake stopâ€
to shut it down.</p>

<p>Either way, you need to run â€œrake db:migrateâ€ before you can run â€œrake specâ€.</p>
