<p>There are a few container images from 2018 which are still available, but they are rather old.
For MASA (highway) images, the current best current practice is to use Capistrano.</p>

<p>A method for deployment via Heroku is being developed.</p>

<h2 id="fountain-registrar-as-a-vm">Fountain Registrar as a VM</h2>

<p>There is an OVA container at <a href="https://minerva.sandelman.ca/qcow/fountain-20210502.ova">https://minerva.sandelman.ca/qcow/fountain-20210502.ova</a></p>

<p>It is 1.1G in size, and uses a thin-provisioned VMDK disk image, which can be as large as 8G, but is currently 3.4G in size (including swap).
(It can be converted via qemu-img to QCOW format to be used with KVM or XEN)</p>

<p>This image will boot up with the name “fountain”, and with the username “fountain”
Root logins are currently disabled, please contact mcr@sandelman.ca for the fountain password.</p>

<p>The image should be run with a <em>bridged</em> network interface to your LAN.
It will use mDNS (avahi) to announce the name “fountain.local”, and the system can be tested for correct operation by doing:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl -k https://fountain.local:8443/version.json
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once logged in, you will find that the application has been installed in /app/fountain.</p>

<p>The logs are in /app/fountain/production.log</p>

<p>The application is started in crontab using the @reboot method.</p>

<p>There are certificates and private keys already generated, which are stored in /app/certificates.   This has been to make your life easier: they should be replaced in any non-testing installtion.</p>

<p>In the home directory, /home/fountain, there is a script “fnt.sh” (a work in progress),
which is used to customize an empty devuan base image.
This image is supposed to apply security updates on it’s own.</p>

<p>The files /home/fountain/.ssh/authorized_keys contain keys that allow logins from Sandelman Software Works.  Remove these or comment them out if you don’t want help.
Add your keys so that you can login with ssh.</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>BRSKI client has been installed in this VM.
It is located at /home/fountain/reach.</p>

<p>To run the test, it is suggested to login in two windows.
In the first window, run:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>tail --follow=name -f /app/logs/production.log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the second window, do:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd ~/reach/spec/files/product/00-D0-E5-02-00-39
./voucher.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The files in that directory are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>device.crt: the IDevID certificate</li>
  <li>key.pem: the private key associated with the IDevID</li>
  <li>honeydukes.txt: a placeholder to say that this came from honeydukes.sandelman.ca</li>
  <li>masa.crt: the trust anchor associated with signing vouchers</li>
  <li>vendor.crt: the trust anchor that signs IDevIDs</li>
</ul>

<p>These files can be used with real pledge code by installing them into the pledge.
Normally, the private key would be transported securely from the MASA (or other PKI infrastructure which created it) into the device, or generated on the device itself.
See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-richardson-t2trg-idevid-considerations/ for many more considerations around this.</p>

<p>In the above test, the pledge reaches out to the local JRC (Registrar), submits a voucher-request.  The JRC then reaches out to the MASA listed in the IDevID extension,
and submits a (parboiled) voucher-request.</p>

<p>A voucher is then returned from the MASA, logged, and then returned to the pledge.</p>

<p>The pledge then does an RFC7030 EST enrollment.</p>

<p>Some missing parts: the  section 5.7 telemetry operation is not yet completed, nor is the section 5.9.4 enrollment status telemetry.
This Registrar does not examine the audit log from the MASA either.</p>
