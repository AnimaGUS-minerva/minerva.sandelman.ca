I"Ä<p>As part of developing a reference design of the ANIMA protocols, and
validating the design, a platform was developed to run ANIMA.</p>

<p>The mark I case contains an Orange PI Zero, plus two additional ethernet
interfaces connected via USB.  With three network interfaces interesting
ACP topologies can be built and tested:</p>

<p>The mark II case adds a serial port to the design making it capable of
doing Out-Of-Band management of router devices.  This is still a prototype,
the plan is to spin a board and produce a slightly smaller case:</p>

<p>A target design would be smaller, and would reduce heat dissipation.
An additional goal is to include one or more TTL outputs that could be
interfaced to something like the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/10747">power-switch Tail</a></p>

<p>The devices are currently powered by USB, and do not require as much power
as typical RPI designs.  They are easily powered from available USB ports,
but if a management goal is to be able to power cycle systems, then causing
the management system to go off as well would be bad.</p>

<p>A stretch goal is therefore to be able to draw power from industry standard
PoE, while also passing PoE power <em>downstream</em> to the next Hermes device
in the daisy chain.  That goal is ambitious.</p>
