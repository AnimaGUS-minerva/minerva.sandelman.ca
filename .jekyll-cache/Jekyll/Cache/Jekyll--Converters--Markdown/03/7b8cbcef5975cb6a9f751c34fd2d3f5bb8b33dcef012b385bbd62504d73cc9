I",<p>The document <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8995">RFC8995</a> was published
by the RFC-editor on May ??, 2021.
It is the result of numerous reviews from 2016 to 2020.
It was approved by the IETFâ€™s IESG in April 2020, but it had to wait in the RFC-editor Q due to normative references to other documents, such as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8994">RFC8994</a>.</p>

<p>More information about this and other implementations of BRSKI can be found at
<a href="https://brski.org">brski.org</a></p>

<p>There are currently five extension documents:</p>

<h2 id="brski-cloud-registrar">BRSKI Cloud Registrar</h2>

<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-anima-brski-cloud">BRSKI Cloud Registrar</a> deals with cases where a device is being deployed into an environment where there is no local bootstrapping support.
It deals primarily with application onboarding where physical connectivity is provided by a wire, or perhaps via another wifi onboarding protocol.</p>

<h2 id="brski-asynchronous-enrollment">BRSKI Asynchronous Enrollment</h2>

<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-anima-brski-async-enroll">Support of asynchronous Enrollment in BRSKI (BRSKI-AE)</a> deals with disconnected uses of BRSKI,
such as when the device to be enrolled has no network at all.
This also describes use of CMP rather than EST for enrollment.</p>

<h2 id="constrained-voucher-and-constrained-brski">Constrained Voucher and Constrained BRSKI</h2>

<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-anima-constrained-voucher">Constrained Voucher Artifacts for Bootstrapping Protocols</a> deals with BRSKI on constrained devices and using challenged networks.  It uses COAPS (CoAP over DTLS) for transport, and COSE signed CBOR for voucher formats.</p>

<h2 id="constrained-join-proxy-for-bootstrapping-protocols">Constrained Join Proxy for Bootstrapping Protocols</h2>

<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-anima-constrained-join-proxy">Constrained Join Proxy for Bootstrapping Protocols</a> supports Constrained-Voucher for the DTLS case.</p>

<h2 id="jose-signed-voucher-artifacts-for-bootstrapping-protocols">JOSE signed Voucher Artifacts for Bootstrapping Protocols</h2>

<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-richardson-anima-jose-voucher">
JOSE signed Voucher Artifacts for Bootstrapping Protocols</a> proposes a new voucher format that uses only JOSE rather than CMS.</p>

<h2 id="autonomic-control-plane-challenges-for-layer-two-switched-networks">Autonomic Control Plane challenges for Layer-Two Switched Networks</h2>

<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-richardson-anima-l2-friendly-acp">
Autonomic Control Plane challenges for Layer-Two Switched Networks
</a> deals with the problem of how to best do ACP discovery and transport in L2 networks.</p>
