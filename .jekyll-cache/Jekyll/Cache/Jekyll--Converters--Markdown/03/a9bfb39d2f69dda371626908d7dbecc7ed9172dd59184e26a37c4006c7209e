I"S<p>Two instances of the Highway MASA have been setup.  They are named
after two shops from the wizarding world of Harry Potter.  See
<a href="/jokeshop">Jokeshop</a> for an explanation of them.</p>

<p>Expect some changes as the created MASA signing keys are both names
localhost, when they should really be named after the Jokeshop.</p>
