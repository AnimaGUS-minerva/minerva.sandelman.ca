I"<p>The IETF ANIMA working group is named as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"Autonomic Networking Integrated Model and Approach"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>ANIMA has a goal:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Autonomic networking refers to the self-managing characteristics
(configuration, protection, healing, and optimization) of distributed
network elements, adapting to unpredictable changes while hiding
intrinsic complexity from operators and users.
[see the Charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/anima/about/)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, an Animagus is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>An Animagus (pl. Animagi) is a witch or wizard who can morph him or
herself into an animal at will.     [wiki entry](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Animagus)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While looking for a name that was related to “ANIMA”, the word “Animagus”
came up.  It was thought, maybe one could call the project after some famour
Animagus!  Maybe “Sirius Black” or “padfoot” (his name as a dog) would be a
good name.  But, the most well known Animagus is Professor Minerva
Mcgonagall.</p>

<p>The name Minerva looked interested, and upon investigation, the name seemed
associated with a lot of actual IoT-like things.  See the <a href="/info">info</a> entry
for more links.</p>
