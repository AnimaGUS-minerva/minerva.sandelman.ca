I"k<p>The Reach Pledge is a ruby application that uses part of the rails framework,
but acts as an https client only.</p>

<p>Reach provides a CLI interface that can be run in a shell to simulate a
pledge activity.  It does not look for the ACP-provided proxy (but it could).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rake reach:send_voucher_request IDEVID=pledge JRC=https://fountain.sandelman.ca
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The address of the JRC must be provided as it is not determinable otherwise.
The provided IDEVID name causes a key pair to be searched for in</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>db/certs/${IDEVID}_primev1.crt
db/private/${IDEVID}_primev1.key
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An HTTPS connection to the provided JRC is made.</p>

<p>The release 0.50 of the Reach pledge simulator only supports PKCS7 signed
raku voucher requests.  This release does not (yet) attempt to do enrollment.</p>
