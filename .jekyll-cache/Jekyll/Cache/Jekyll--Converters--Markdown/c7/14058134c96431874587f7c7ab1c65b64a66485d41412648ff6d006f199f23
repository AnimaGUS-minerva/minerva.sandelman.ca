I"á<p>The Minerva ecosystem consists of a number of components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/highway">highway</a> is the Minerva IDevID creator/signer, and the Manufacturer
Authorized Signing Authority (masa).  It is run by the manufacturer to
create the IDevID certificates, and as a public facing service to generate
vouchers in response to signed voucher requests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/fountain">fountain</a> is the Minerva domain owner, the Join
Registrar/Coordinator, and it also operates as an integrated Certification
Authority, issuing LDevIDs to the new nodes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/chariwt">ChariWT</a> is a voucher library. It is used by all three other components
to create and validate vouchers.  It can do so in PKCS7 signed JSON format,
as well as JOSE signed JSON (JWS) and COSE signed CBOR (CWT).  It is named
for the last format.  It is pronounced like ‚ÄúChariot‚Äù, given a Welsh ‚ÄúW‚Äù,
as CWT is pronounced ‚Äòcot‚Äô.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
