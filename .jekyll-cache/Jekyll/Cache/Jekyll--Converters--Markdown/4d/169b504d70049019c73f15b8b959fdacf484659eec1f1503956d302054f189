I"©<p>After trying to build the site with a stock time-machine jekyll theme (which
is installed via Gem, plus minor overrides), I gave up and switched to
feeling-responsive.</p>

<p>Feeling-responsive is not installed via Gemfile, rather one either downloads
a zip file and starts from that, or does a git merge of the bare-bones
version.  I did the later, but perhaps will start again from a zip file,
because I donâ€™t really want my history polluted with the feeling-responsive
code.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I fixed/upgraded one thing in the base code so that I
could put an icon the header, and upstreaming that, while also having my code
based upon it is a bit annoying.</p>
