I"<p>The Fountain JRC is a ruby-on-rails web application.</p>

<p>It provides a domain owner with an end-point to which pledges apply for
access.  It receives the (<a href="/terminology#raku">raku</a>) voucher request, stores
and extracts the MASA URL.</p>

<p>Fountain then reaches out to the indicated MASA, and submits a
(<a href="/terminology#bisque">bisque</a>) voucher request to get an actual voucher.</p>

<p>The voucher is relayed to the pledge.</p>

<p>The release 0.50 of the Fountain JRC does not yet support the actual
enrollment process.  Thatâ€™s simply an matter of not yet implemented.</p>

<p>Unsigned voucher requests and offline renewals are also not yet supported.</p>

<p>There are few negative (challenge, or attack) test cases.</p>

<p>As part of the Minerva project two public JRCs have been set up.</p>
