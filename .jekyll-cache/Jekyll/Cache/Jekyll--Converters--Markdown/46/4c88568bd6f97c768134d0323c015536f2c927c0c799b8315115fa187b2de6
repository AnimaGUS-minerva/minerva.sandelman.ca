I"w<p>The ChariWT library deals with creating and validating vouchers and voucher-requests.</p>

<p>Release 0.50 currently supports PKCS7-signed JSON, and and some poorly tested
code to deal with JWS-signed-JSON.  Vestiges of CWT format vouchers exists,
but has yet to be completed.</p>

<p>The intention is for all three formats to be supported transparently to the
calling application.</p>

<p>ChariWT does not long term storage of vouchers, nor does it provide any of
the semantic policy associated with the different kinds of vouchers.</p>
