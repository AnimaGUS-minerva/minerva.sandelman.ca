<p>Minerva is the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare.
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva">Wikipedia</a> and
<a href="https://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/goddesses/minerva/">Greek God and Goddesses</a>
also list Minerva has being the patron of arts, trade, medicine, poetry, handicrafts and strategy.</p>

<p>Minerva was in charge of so many things that she was the “goddess of a thousand works”.
This seems like an appropriate goddess for the Internet of Things!</p>

<p>Minerva is usually depicted with a shield and spear, but the spear is often noted to not be in a
position to attack, but rather defending, or offering sympathy to those defeated.</p>

<p>Minerva is the <a href="https://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/greek-vs-roman-gods/">Roman name</a> for the
goddess Athena, but some reading suggests that they have slightly different personalities.
Besides, Project Athena is a well known MIT desktop project which spawned many things still in use
today (Kerberos being one of them).</p>

<p>The project went online in mid-October 2017.</p>

<p>The project is initially a proof of concept for a number of IETF
specifications.  The results will be an open source reference implementation
which can be used by any number of entities (both for-profit and non-profit)
to create secure and easily managed devices.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sandelman.ca/">Sandelman Software Works</a> has some very specific
ideas of how to apply this technology to real world situations, and it will
become the core of a number of products.   This web site is not about those
products, but about the technology infrastructure to support them.</p>
